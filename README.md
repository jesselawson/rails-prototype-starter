# Rails template with basic user auth included

This is a template I use to quickly prototype ideas. 

This rails project is a fresh install of Rails `7.0.4` 
running on ruby `3.1.3`, with the following features 
implemented:
- User registration
- User authentication
- Forgot password handling

Ready for your exciting idea. 

Not battle-tested; I make significant changes to this 
architecture before taking a prototype into closed 
beta.
